## Project Structure

Overview of the file/folder structure if necessary.

```plaintext
project-name/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── ...
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
└── Makefile
```

## Prerequisites
```plaintext
Docker 
Python 3.9
```

## Installation and Setup
Clone the repository
```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/jainmilky66/FastAPI-Project-66
cd project-name
```

## Usage
Running with Docker
Step-by-step instructions on how to build and run the project with Docker.

```plaintext
# Build the Docker image
make build

# Run the Docker container
make run

# Start the application with Docker Compose
make compose-up

# End the application with Docker Compose
make compose-down
```

## Accessing the Application
Explain how to access the app and what URLs to visit. 
```plaintext
API Endpoint: http://localhost:8002
Swagger UI: http://localhost:8002/docs
```

## Development and Testing
Running Locally: You can also run the FastAPI application locally (without Docker) by executing:
```plaintext
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
This will start the FastAPI server on http://localhost:8002.
Testing API Endpoints: Use the Swagger UI at /docs to interact with and test the API endpoints directly in your browser.


## Additional Notes
1. Persistence: This setup does not include a database, but you can add one by modifying the docker-compose.yml and connecting it to the FastAPI app.

2. Scaling: For deployment, consider using orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to scale and manage the application.
